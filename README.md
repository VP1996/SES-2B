## A multi-level authentication method and system for teaching attendance 

A high-strength and interactive system with double authentication of teacher-student attendance. 

Three levels of authentication:
1.	identity authentication based on dynamic facial features 
2.	interactive authentication based on real-time information
3.	location-based authentication


## Run the app
might need to do a few npm installs :))
```lua

To run backend and client together on one terminal: 
1. npm install 
2. npm start
(make sure you have run `npm install` in both client and backend folders first).

OR 

To run both client and backend on separate terminals: 
To start the client:
1. cd client
2. npm start

To start the server:
1. cd backend
2. nodemon students.js

Client launches on localhost:3000, Server on localhost:4000
```
